							<h2>What is Augmented Reality</h2> 
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/ar.jpg" alt="Picture of Augmented Reality on Smart Phone" /></span>
							
						  <p>Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are two sides of the same coin. You could think of Augmented Reality as VR with one foot in the real world: Augmented Reality simulates artificial objects in the real environment; Virtual Reality creates an artificial environment to inhabit.
						In Augmented Reality, the computer uses sensors and algorithms to determine the position and orientation of a camera. AR technology then renders the 3D graphics as they would appear from the viewpoint of the camera, superimposing the computer-generated images over a userâ€™s view of the real world.
